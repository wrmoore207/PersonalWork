This was my final project for my Introduction to Machine Learning course during the Fall 2023 semester. I attempted to apply unsupervised learning algorithms to raw music data. 
Overall, the project was a success in that I learned about feature selection, dimension reduction, and clustering algorithms. However, as you will see the results were not exemplary. 
Hopefully, this project will grow over time as I have plans to incorporate parts of it into future projects.
